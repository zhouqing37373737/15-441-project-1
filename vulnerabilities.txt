1.vulnerable to memory usage: If there's no available memory to allocate for buffer, realloc would return NULL and server would crash.
2.to enable dynamic buffer assignment,buffersize is always 4096 bits more than actual usage
3.the max connection is subject to fd limit, if exceeds server would crash. Possibly could implement connection pooling.
4.the max read/write data size can't be more than 10MB.
